# react-devstack

> An ultimate opinionated universal React devstack. Don't hassle with project build and other stuff, just do what matters: start developing your application, right now!

# Getting started

In order to get started as easily as possible, we have prepared CLI utility to make app bootstrapping a breeze.

1. Install `react-devstack-cli` globally using: `npm install react-devstack-cli -g`
2. Create an empty React project using the CLI (it's called `rdc`): `rdc create project-name`
3. After generating the project, CLI will guide you, however in case you wondered just: `cd project-name`
4. And start the app using `npm run dev`

It will automatically open your browser upon compilation.

Enjoy all the hot-reloading, server side rendering etc. :-)
